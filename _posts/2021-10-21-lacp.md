## Introduction
```
Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP),

LACP, as specified in IEEE 802.3ad, implements dynamic link aggregation and de-aggregation, 
allowing LACP-enabled switches at both ends to exchange Link Aggregation Control Protocol Data Units (LACPDUs). 
LACP provides a standard negotiation mechanism that a Huawei switch can use to create and enable the aggregated link based on its configuration. 
After an aggregated link is formed, LACP is responsible for maintaining the link. LACP adjusts the link if an aggregated link's status changes.

For example, in Figure 1, four interfaces on DeviceA should be connected to the corresponding interfaces on DeviceB, 
and these interfaces are all bundled into an Eth-Trunk. However, one interface on DeviceA is connected to an interface on DeviceC. 
As a result, DeviceA may send data destined for DeviceB to DeviceC. In manual mode, this fault would go undetected.

In this case, if LACP is enabled on DeviceA and DeviceB, the Eth-Trunk only selects active links (links connected to DeviceB) to forward data after negotiation. 
Data sent by DeviceA destined for DeviceB only reaches DeviceB.

                 link1
DeviceA+--------------------------------+DeviceB
       |         link2                  |
       |--------------------------------|
       |         link3                  |
       |--------------------------------|
       |         link4                  
       |--------------------------------+DeviceC


The concepts in LACP include:

LACP system priority:
LACP system priorities determine the sequence in which devices at two ends of an Eth-Trunk select active interfaces to join a LAG. 
In order for a LAG to be established, both devices must select the same interfaces as active interfaces. 
To achieve this, one device (with a higher priority) is responsible for selecting the active interfaces. 
The other device (with a lower priority) then selects the same interfaces as active interfaces. In priority comparisons, 
numerically lower values have higher priority.

LACP interface priority:
LACP interface priorities affect which interfaces of an Eth-Trunk are selected as active interfaces. 
A smaller numerical value represents a higher priority. The interfaces with the highest LACP interface priority become active interfaces.

M:N backup of member interfaces:
LACP mode is also called M:N mode, where M refers to the number of active links and N refers to the number of backup links. 
This mode guarantees high reliability and allows traffic to be load balanced among M active links.

In Figure 2, M+N links with the same attributes (in the same LAG) are set up between two devices. 
When data is transmitted over the aggregated link, traffic is load balanced among M active links, with no data transmitted over N backup links. 
Therefore, the actual bandwidth of the aggregated link is the sum of the M links' bandwidth, 
and the maximum bandwidth of the aggregated link is the sum of the (M+N) links' bandwidth.

If one of the M links fails, LACP selects one of the N backup links to replace the faulty link. 
The actual bandwidth of the aggregated link is still the sum of M links' bandwidth, 
but the maximum bandwidth of the aggregated link is the sum of the (M+N-1) links' bandwidth.

``` 

## LACP Implementation
```
# 先根据system priority选举出Actor，然后由Actor选择active port。

LACP-enabled switches exchange LACPDUs. An LACPDU contains the LACP system priority, MAC address, LACP interface priority, interface number, and operational key.

An Eth-Trunk in LACP mode is set up as follows:
1.After member interfaces are added to an Eth-Trunk in LACP mode, both ends send LACPDUs.
2.Devices at both ends determine the Actor and active links.

In Figure 2, when DeviceB receives LACPDUs from DeviceA, DeviceB checks and records information about DeviceA and compares LACP system priorities. 
If the LACP system priority of DeviceA is higher than that of DeviceB, DeviceA becomes the Actor. 
If DeviceA and DeviceB have the same LACP system priority, the device with a smaller MAC address becomes the Actor.

After the Actor is selected, both devices select active interfaces based on the interface priorities of the Actor. 
If priorities of interfaces on the Actor are the same, interfaces with smaller interface numbers are selected as active interfaces. 
An Eth-Trunk is established when both devices select the same interfaces as active interfaces. Active links then load balance traffic.

```

## Load Balancing
```
# 根据流进行balancing，两端各自进行balancing，所以收发可能走不同的link。

Because an Eth-Trunk between two devices consists of multiple physical links bundled together, 
an Eth-Trunk may transmit data frames of the same data flow over different physical links. 
A potential problem arises in that the second data frame may arrive at the remote device earlier than the first data frame, resulting in out-of-order packets.

To prevent out-of-order packets, Eth-Trunk uses flow-based load balancing. 
This mechanism uses the hash algorithm to calculate the address in a data frame 
and generate a hash key based on which the system searches for the outbound interface in the Eth-Trunk forwarding table. 
Each MAC or IP address corresponds to a hash key, so the system uses different outbound interfaces to forward data. 
This mechanism ensures that frames of the same data flow are forwarded on the same physical link and implements load balancing of data flows. 
Flow-based load balancing ensures that data is transmitted in the correct sequence, but cannot ensure efficient bandwidth usage.

You can set the load balancing mode based on traffic models. When a parameter of traffic changes frequently, 
you can set the load balancing mode based on this parameter to ensure that the traffic is load balanced evenly. 
For example, if IP addresses in packets change frequently, use the load balancing mode based on dst-ip, src-ip, 
or src-dst-ip so that traffic can be properly load balanced among physical links. 
If MAC addresses in packets change frequently and IP addresses are fixed, use the load balancing mode based on 
dst-mac, src-mac, or src-dst-mac so that traffic can be properly load balanced among physical links.

## LACP是如何工作的？
```
LACP为数据交换设备提供一种标准的协商方式，系统根据自身配置自动形成聚合链路，并启动聚合链路收发数据。LACP通过链路聚合控制协议数据单元LACPDU（Link Aggregation Control Protocol Data Unit）与对端交互信息，LACPDU报文中包含设备的系统优先级、MAC地址、接口优先级、接口号和操作Key等信息，对端接收到这些信息后，将这些信息与其它端口所保存的信息比较以选择能够汇聚的端口，双方对端口加入或退出某个动态聚合组达成一致，确定承担业务流量的链路。

LACP主要工作主要包含互发LACPDU报文、确定主动端、确定活动链路、链路切换，具体实现如下。

互发LACPDU报文
在对接的两台设备上创建Eth-Trunk并配置为LACP模式，然后向Eth-Trunk中手工加入成员接口。此时成员接口上便启用了LACP协议，两端互发LACPDU报文，LACPDU报文中包含设备的系统优先级、MAC地址、接口优先级、接口号和操作Key等信息。

确定主动端
两端设备均会收到对端发来的LACPDU报文。以DeviceB为例，当DeviceB收到DeviceA发送的报文时，DeviceB会查看并记录对端信息，然后比较系统优先级字段，如果DeviceA的系统优先级高于本端的系统优先级，则确定DeviceA为LACP主动端。如果DeviceA和DeviceB的系统优先级相同，比较两端设备的MAC地址，MAC地址小的一端为LACP主动端。

确定活动链路
选出主动端后，设备两端会以主动端的接口优先级来选择活动接口，如果主动端的接口优先级都相同则选择接口编号比较小的为活动接口。LACP模式支持设置活动接口数上限阈值以在保证带宽的情况下提高网络可靠性，当前活动接口数目达到上限阈值时，再向Eth-Trunk中添加成员接口，不会增加Eth-Trunk活动接口的数目，超过上限阈值的链路状态将被置为Down，作为备份链路。两端设备选择了一致的活动接口，活动链路组便可以建立起来，这些活动链路以负载分担的方式转发数据。
如下图所示，LACP模式下，如果活动链路数上限阈值为2，通过LACP协商后，链路1和链路2因为优先级较高被选作活动链路，链路3则为备份链路。聚合链路中的活动链路参与数据转发，总带宽等于被选中的活动链路带宽之和。

链路切换
LACP模式链路聚合组中如果某条活动链路故障，链路聚合组自动在备份链路中选择一条优先级最高的链路作为活动链路接替故障链路，参与数据转发的链路数目不变，保证数据传输的可靠性。LACP模式链路聚合组两端设备中任何一端检测到以下事件，都会触发聚合组的链路切换：

链路Down事件。
以太网OAM检测到链路失效。
LACP协议发现链路故障。
接口不可用。
在使能了LACP抢占功能的前提下，更改备份接口的优先级高于当前活动接口的优先级。
当满足上述切换条件其中之一时，按照如下步骤进行切换：

关闭故障链路。
从N条备份链路中选择优先级最高的链路接替活动链路中的故障链路。
优先级最高的备份链路转为活动状态并转发数据，完成切换。
```
